# AI Interview & Candidate Scoring Platform

## Overview – What This Project Does

This application enables interviewers to conduct automated, AI-driven interviews using bots.  
Candidates are evaluated based on their responses and assigned a **score from 1 to 100**, helping determine their eligibility for a role.

Key capabilities include:

- Automated response analysis
- Weighted scoring based on topics and criteria
- Candidate ranking and evaluation
- Integrated frontend and backend architecture

The goal is to significantly reduce manual screening time while improving consistency and objectivity in candidate evaluation.
